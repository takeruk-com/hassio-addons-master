# Home Assistant Add-ons by dy1io

## About

These are a collection of add-ons for Home Assistant that I've either built myself or modified
from another source to serve my needs. Add-ons found here are typically born out
of my own needs, but I publish them here in case anyone else finds them useful. These are
available for use **at your own risk**. I try my best to ensure everything works, 
but there are no guarantees of support, functionality, or that they will be free 
of bugs, even catastrophic ones.


## Installation

Add the repository url listed below to your Supervisor Add-on Store tab in Home
Assistant.

## Thank you

A special thank you to everyone at [Home Assistant Community Add-ons][addons-community].
I've learned a great deal about Home Assistant and the development process from 
their project and I really appreciate all of their work. Be sure to check out 
their [repository][community-addons-repo] of add-ons as well.
